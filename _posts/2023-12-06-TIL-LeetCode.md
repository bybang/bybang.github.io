## ðŸŽ¯ Strategy

### The problem concept

A simple way to solve this problem is by comparing two arrays. We will compare the original and expected array, in which the expected array is sorted.

Then, we will return a count of the numbers that don't have the same value.

## Regular approach

### `sorted()` approach

We can sort the original array and assign it to a new variable, `sort_h`.

Set a counter to count if the original and sorted array `sort_h` items don't have the same value.

```python
def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = 0
        sort_h = sorted(heights)

        ...
```

Then, loop through the array until `i` reaches the end. We will do the logic that is explained above.

```python
def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = 0
        sort_h = sorted(heights)

        for i in range(len(heights)):
        	if heights[i] != sort_h[i]:
            	counter += 1

        ...
```

Finally, we will return a counter, which is the number of numbers that do not match.

```python
def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = 0
        sort_h = sorted(heights)

        for i in range(len(heights)):
        	if heights[i] != sort_h[i]:
            	counter += 1

        return counter
```

The time complexity is `O(nlogn)` because the dominant factor in the time complexity is the sorting operation, and `sorted()` typically has a time complexity of `O(nlogn)`. The loop has a linear time complexity, but it doesn't dominate overall time complexity.

The space complexity is `O(n)`, which means the sorted array `sort_h` requires extra space to store a new array.

## advanced approach

### Two-liner approach

This time, we will condense the above code into two lines of code.

The process assigning to a variable `sort_h` is the same.

```python
def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        sort_h = sorted(heights)
        return sum([0 if heights[i] == sort_h[i] else 1 for i in range(len(heights))])
```

Notice we return a `sum` value of the array, while if two numbers are the same, the array is `0`; otherwise, the array should be `1`.

Then, we return the sum of `1`s in the array.

The time complexity is `O(nlogn)` because we just condensed. Hence, the logic is the same.

The space complexity is `O(n)`, which has the same space complexity as above.

## ðŸ“Œ Thoughts

The first `counter` logic was quite simple, and I just had to bring some `sorted()` logic from the memory.

I checked more solutions but brought this two-liner approach because it's intuitive and easy to understand.

## ðŸ’» Solution

### Regular approach

```python
def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = 0
        sort_h = sorted(heights)

        for i in range(len(heights)):
        	if heights[i] != sort_h[i]:
            	counter += 1

        return counter
```

### Two-liner approach

```python
def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        sort_h = sorted(heights)
        return sum([0 if heights[i] == sort_h[i] else 1 for i in range(len(heights))])
```

# ðŸ”– Review

## Problem type - Array(in-place)

This is a review problem, so there is no strategy part. But there will be two approaches: the in-place approach and the one-liner approach.

## ðŸ’» Solution

### Two-pointer approach

```python
def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        k = 0

        for num in nums:
        	if num != val:
            	nums[k] = num
            	k += 1

        return k
```

### One-liner approach

```python
def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        nums[:] = [i for i in nums if i != val]
```

The time complexity is `O(n)` because the function iterates through the array only once.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because the list comprehension creates a new list, but it does not depend on the size of the input array.

## ðŸ“Œ Thoughts

When I solved this question for the first time, I couldn't solve the problem easily. After solving a few similar types of questions, it took less time, which made me feel accomplished.
