# Python Lists (Arrays)

What would you do if you wanted to describe the days of the week or fruits that you love?

```python
# ❌ wrong example
fruits = "🍎"
fruits = "🍊"
fruits = "🍌"
```

That might not be a great idea, but how about `fruits = "🍎", "🍊", "🍌"` or `days_of_week = "Mon, Tues, Wed, ..."`
This will not work either. Instead, we have an option for the `list`.

```python
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May"]
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌"]
```

If you know JavaScript, this will be familiar as an `array`. This `list` requires `[]` square brackets and fills the inside with the data types.

## Python methods

Python has data types like `string` and `int`. Methods are the functions that bond to the data types.

```python
print("Hello world") # function
name = "Luis"
print(name)
name.upper() # method
print(name)
```

Can you see the difference? Python data types have built-in functions that allow developers to use them.

> _Check out the documentation if you are interested._ > https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str

To try methods, write the data type and put `.` next to it, and you will see the available methods.

❗methods are connected to the data type, so they cannot be used by themselves. `print()` and `int()` are functions, not methods.

```python
name = "Philip"

print(name.capitalize()) # ✅

print(capitalize()) # ❌
```

## List `.append()`

Let's go back to our list.

```python
half_year = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May"]
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌"]
```

If you want to add something to your list, use the `.append()` method.

```python
print(half_year)
print(fruits)
half_year.append("June")
fruits.append("🍈")
print(half_year)
print(fruits)
```

![Alt text](</images/2023-03-01-python_05/Screen Shot 2023-03-01 at 5.24.26 PM.png>)

It appended `June` and `melon` to the lists!

## Indexing

Now, you may want to use the items on the list. But `print(fruits)` returns the whole list.
That is where Python indexing comes in.

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈"]
# To get banana
print(fruits[2])
# To get orange
print(fruits[1])
# To get an apple
print(fruits[0])
# To get the last item on the list
print(fruits[-1])
```

As you can check with the example above, **indexing** is a way to refer individual items from the list by their position.

❗Caution: indexing starts with `0`, not `1` in programming.
If you want to get the list's first item, `list[0]` is correct.

```python
my_list = ["first", "second", "third", "fourth", "last"]
0 1 2 3 4 ... 👉 # index 0 to ...
# my_list[0] == "first"
-4 -3 -2 -1 ... 👈 # index -1 to ...
# my_list[-1] == "last"
```

`List` can contain all the data types we have learned previously.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "first", "second", "third", [11, 22, 33, ["Hi I'm nested list", "hello"]], True, False]
```

## Slicing

We learned how to get the individual item from the list. But what if you want multiple items? The answer is slicing.

```python
fruits = ["🚗", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
```

Let's bring our fruits list again. There are some items that are not fruit. To get only fruits, do this.

```python
fruits = ["🚗", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[1:4])
"""
>> result should be ['🍊', '🍌', '🍈']
"""
```

There are a couple of things you need to check.

```python
fruits[1:4]
```

The first number, `1`, is where you want to start slicing. The second number, `4`, is where you want to stop slicing.

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[0:4])
```

If our `fruits` list contains an apple, the slicing would start at `0`. It is a bit confusing, but it is helpful.

Another thing we need to know about slicing is how we can reverse the list.

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[0:4:1])
```

Same as we do for slicing, add one more column, and that will decide the reading direction and step.
For example, `fruits[0:5:2]` will return `['🍎', '🍌', '🍹']`

```python
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈", "🍹"]
print(fruits[0:4:1]) # 1 is default
print(frutis[0:5:2]) # `['🍎', '🍌', '🍹']`
print(fruits[::-1])
# returns ['🍹', '🍈', '🍌', '🍊', '🍎']
```

For the last `print`, we didn't write anything for the `start` and `stop` values but the `step`. As you can see the result, it reverses the list because the step value has changed to `-1`.

Try a couple more slices to familiarize yourself with slice and reverse.

```python
print(fruits[::-2])
print(fruits[1::-1])
print(fruits[:-3:-1])
print(fruits[-3::-1])
```

## Tuples

### Mutable / Immutable

Before we dive into tuples, we need to step back for mutable and immutable.

```python
days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")
fruits = ["🍎", "🍊", "🍌", "🍈"]
```

As you know, the' list' comes in if we want to use some ordered sequence of values. But what if we want the list but want to keep the value the same?

```python
days = ("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday")
days. # check this in your terminal
```

❗To summarize, **mutable** means you can modify the value after you create the data, and **immutable** means you cannot modify the data.

### Tuple

The `tuple` is a list but cannot modify values inside. Remember, if we put `.` after the data types, we can see the methods? Same as `list`, `tuple` has methods but cannot `.append()` or `.pop()`.

![Alt text](</images/2023-03-01-python_05/Screen Shot 2023-03-01 at 9.45.40 PM.png>)

The same point with the `list` is indexing, which is the way of reading items in the `list/tuple`.
