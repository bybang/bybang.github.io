# ðŸŽ¯ What I learned today

## Mario

### Create a block

Imagine we want to emulate the blocks in the game Super Mario Brothers.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/d3e3e018-be39-4d61-9221-2d20cdfe3a44/image.png)

There are four question mark blocks in the sky, and we are trying to change those blocks into a textual version.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/ee07ec6e-6bc7-44e8-aaca-60ca14bf01c8/image.png)

Probably the picture above is the simplest way to implement those four horizontal blocks using pure text.

But we've seen that there are better ways to do this, and if we want to generalize this code to be five, six or sixty question marks, the _**loop**_ is always the answer for not repeating ourselves.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
  {
    printf("?");
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```

Notice we placed the `printf("\n");` after the loop, because when we place it inside, it creates a vertical block.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/28676ba2-2ab2-4a00-91ad-c5d9fb8ca954/image.png)

What if we want to do some other scene from Mario such as the picture above?

We can modify our code like below to make the vertical obstacles.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b996c54c-2134-48cf-a078-3cfa758b2ce6/image.png)

### Advanced blocks

To escalate things one level further, when we're in the underground version of Mario, there's lot of obstructions like the one picture below.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/40611eed-d09a-4029-97d3-01ef48ce9fcf/image.png)

That is not a single line, but the grids or bricks or combined three-by-three group of blocks.

We can think logically that we want to print three rows of bricks and three columns of bricks together. Take this problem into a smalle pieces, we can start from the loop.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
  {

  }
}
```

The loop above will do something three times, even though there is nothing inside yet.

Then, if we want to print out a row of three bricks in the same line, that's similar to the four question marks in the sky.

To compose one into the other, we can change our code like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++)
    {
      printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

Notice we used the different integer `i` and `j` for the loop, that's because if we use the same name, it could cause a collision or trouble.

Combine one loop to the other, the inner `j` loop will prints out the vertical row, and the outer `i` loop will prints out the new line, and make three columns.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/5db0f5b4-1f57-4e00-84d0-d779bf96127b/image.png)

But this is not the best design, because suppose if we want to change the size of grid and the grid is always square, we have to manually change the numbers and eventually will make some mistake.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int n = 3;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
      printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

We can solve the issue above by initialize `n` for numbers. The above code has better design, because there's a lower probability of mistakes.

But technically we can still screw up somehow, by accidentally changing the `n` value. To prevent this error, we can declare `n` to be a `constant` using the keyword `const`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  const int n = 3; // Chaged here
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
      printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

That's the way of programming more defensively, and it's a good practice. The defensive programming makes our code better designed because it's less vulnerable to mistakes by us, collegues or anyone else using the code.

### Ask user

We can make our code to prompt the user for the size of the grid.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/3b821eb9-697d-4d63-b470-dd111e338bb1/image.png)

Don't forget to include the `cs50 library` to use `get_int` function.

Notice the `get_int` function deals with erroneous input, if the user type something like a string `cat`.

But we only desinged a function to get an integer, and the user input might be negative, positive, zero or some combination thereof.

It's clear that if we allow user to type the negative 1 for the size of the grid, so let's force the user to give the program a positive value.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int n = get_int("Size: ");
  while (n < 1)
  {
    n = get_int("Size: ");
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
      printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

The code here is the better design, because it's only two requests for the information. But we are using two identical lines, which is not ideal.

That is the best time to introduce the third loop, a do-while loop.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  int n;
  do
  {
    n = get_int("Size: ");
  }
  while (n < 1);

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
      printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

Do-while loop is in C, and other languages like Python doesn't have it. Even though the code above seems a little weird, that we have to decalre variable at top and then check it below, it is the cleanest way to achieve the logic so far.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/2d9d3e27-6ae4-4c40-a2ba-54a488b6639c/image.png)

A general piece of advice within programming is that we should never fully trust the user. They will likely misbehave, typing incorrect values where they should not.

We can protect our program from bad behavior by checking to make sure the user's input satisfies our needs (_defensive programming_).

## Comments

### Leave a note

In Scratch, there was ability to leava a yellow sticky notes that we can add citations or explanations.

There's a couple of ways to write `comments` in C, and in general comments are for ourselves or for colleagues as to what the shared code is doing and why or how.

For instance, we can leave our fisrt note as follows:

```c
int main(void)
{
  // Get size of grid
  int n;
  do
  {
    n = get_int("Size: ");
  }
  while (n < 1);

  ...
}
```

Notice the comments begin with a `//`, involve placing `//` into the code followed by a comment. It's just an explanatory remark in terse English that generally explains the next chunk of code.

```c
int main(void)
{
  // Get size of grid
  int n;
  do
  {
    n = get_int("Size: ");
  }
  while (n < 1);

  // Print grid of bricks
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
      printf("#");
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

There is another comment to ourself that makes the code more understandable by adding some English explanation thereof.

Comments are the fundamental parts of a computer program to ourselves and especially ohters when we collaborating with our code.

Typically each comment is a few words or more, providing the reader an opportunity to understand what is happening in a special block of code. Further, the comments are good reminder for us later when we need to revise our code.

## Abstraction

### Abstract existing blocks

Suppose we don't know where to begin with our code, but we have a instruction or `comments` for the program.

```c
int main(void)
{
  // Get size of grid


  // Print grid of bricks


}
```

Comments are good way to getting started because it can be an approximation of pseudocode. And the code above really just represents how our program or `function` should work.

```c
int main(void)
{
  // Get size of grid
  int n = get_size();

  // Print grid of bricks
  print_grid();

}

int get_size(void)
{
  int n;
  do
  {
    n = get_int("Size: ");
  }
  while (n < 1);
  return n
}



```

We created a function that get the size what user wants, and doesn't take any input but returns an integer. This is the syntax of C, and we will learn that in another time.

Another term here is a `return`, which means the function will hand back to any funtion that uses that function the value in question.

### Libraries

After jiggling the codes, we might be curious about the first line of code. If we delete the first line, what error message do we get?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f7b4e676-6776-41ed-bd73-e2f290cc7579/image.png)

From the error message, we can figure that we declare the `printf` function without a library.

The statement in the first line, `#include <stdio.h>`, is a special command that tells the compiler that we want to use the capabilities of _**library**_ called `standard input and output`.

Think of it as importing a library, or in Scratch, we import an extension like text-to-speech. That was the same as adding a library.

Library is the third-party written code, or someone else wrote it in this case. Same in C, we don't automatically get the `printf` function. We have to **include** a _**header file**_ that declares the `printf` function to exist.

If you are interested in what functions in the library, check out [here](https://manual.cs50.io/). Also, CS50 has its own library called `cs50.h`; you can check it on the same page above.

## Variables

### Ask and answer block

Recall that in Scratch, we had the ability to ask the user name as an input and say hello with that name appended to it like this: `"hello, (your name).`

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/33b77049-e510-4478-a8bc-4431cabc19bf/image.png)

We can use a `get_string` function from the cs50 library that collects the user input and the quotes. At the end of the string, leave the space for the user so that the cursor moves one space after the sentence.

Notice in C that we have to be a little more specific than Scratch. In C, if we want to get a function's return value, we have to use an equal sign and the variable's name on the left.

The equal sign doesn't mean equality, but the assignment, which means copying the value on the right over to the value on the left.

Yet, there is one more thing, which is why we call C pedantic language: we need to tell C what type of value we are storing.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/1282954b-fe8a-4bac-ac2e-fa6065f4a11d/image.png)

When we move to the VS Code, we add the `cs50.h` library on the top, and then the answer is passed to the `printf` function.

But what is the `%s` sign?

### Format codes

One step back to the Scratch, we had the best solution for the same function above. The `join` block was the elegant solution for using the `say` block and the input.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/731b8e98-f4de-4f39-a99b-39458b521112/image.png)

The picture above is how we translate the `say` and the `join` blocks. It is not perfectly matched, but this is how we can implement the same function.

The percent sign or a placeholder is known as a `format code` in C, especially for `printf`. This means the `%s` is a placeholder for a string, the s stands for string, and we ask the computer to plug in some value here.

The function `printf` is smart enough to take the answer and go back to the `hello %s\n` if we have `%s` and one additional argument after the comma inside of the function.

To sum up, the `get_string` function is used to get a string from the user. Then, the variable `answer` is passed to the `printf` function. The `%s` sign tells the `printf` function to prepare itself to receive a string.

Same as the `answer`, we can define the name of the _variable_ and the type of the variable. There are many **data types**, such as _int, bool, char_, and many others.

## Conditionals

### If block

Another building block we utilized within Scratch was that of _conditionals_, or the `if-else` block.

Suppose we want to compare two values, and in Scratch, we have a block for that ability.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/0d5e3720-d036-4d43-a770-0db39362ce99/image.png)

Notice that the right side keyword is almost identical to the left; that's because MIT borrowed those keywords.

What if there is a three-way fork in the road? In Scratch, it is unwieldy graphically. The code might look like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/6728684a-dad8-4ace-a0f3-0af22fd99551/image.png)

Notice the block is kind of a mess. If we nitpick or critique the design of our code, we can figure out that the third question is unnecessary.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/0beb99ab-0d29-4116-8d6f-a6ad26b647fc/image.png)

By reducing redundant conditional, we produce a minor tweak from the original.

Let's now go to the VS Code and write the code in C.

Type `code compare.c` in your terminal window, and it will create a new file named `compare.c`. Once we close and run the command again, it will open the existing file with the same name.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b0af4a61-05c4-4470-82a6-37576a8fcc07/image.png)

And if we write the code without a typo, our program should run like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f51433d3-043c-43dd-b8a0-56d4c5187510/image.png)

Notice that we created variables `x and y` and set variables to an int or integer. These values are populated using the `get_int()` from the CS50 library.

Our program can only check if x is less than y, so we need to improve our program by coding as follows:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/a25edd0e-689e-4b35-9264-8aa3cf8df8f5/image.png)

Now, all potential outcomes are accounted for.

### Another example program

If we are building a program that asks if you agree or not, we can build the program like this:

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");

  if (c == 'y')
  {
    printf("Agreed.\n");
  }
  else if (c == 'n')
  {
    printf("Not agreed.\n");
  }
}
```

Compile this program and run it. The program works but in a little obnoxious way. We must manually type the lowercase and can't use the capital `Y or N`.

Another point is that we used double quotes for the `string` and single quotes for the `character`.

This is a necessity in C; when we are dealing with strings, such as text, a name, a sentence or anything more than one character, we typically use a `""`. When dealing with deliberately single characters, we must use `''`. Because of this, we let the computer know the content inside of the single quote is indeed a `char`, not a string.

Back to the code, how can we improve our program to take both lower and upper characters?

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");

  if (c == 'y')
  {
    printf("Agreed.\n");
  }
  else if (c == 'Y')
  {
    printf("Agreed.\n");
  }
  else if (c == 'n')
  {
    printf("Not agreed.\n");
  }
  else if (c == 'N')
  {
    printf("Not agreed.\n");
  }
}
```

This could be a correct solution, but perhaps not the best design. Another term of art here, we can say the code smell is a little off. That's because we repeat the same thing but want the code to be different.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/808b3685-a928-4ed2-871b-5e05ed6e45eb/image.png)

The code above has a third smaller size than the original and less redundancy, which has a better design. Also, we have to mention that we have a new operator, `||`, which effectively means _or_.

## Loops

### Meow program

Recall that we made a meow block in Scratch that sounds like a cat meowing several times.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/923848b8-5d71-4cfb-a839-120548059250/image.png)

There is no sound block in C so that we will rely on the print. The program above in C will be as follows:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  printf("meow\n");
  printf("meow\n");
  printf("meow\n");
}
```

As we learned through the course, this is not the best design. To implement the loop in C, we need to know the syntax of the loop.

If we set the counter to count a number, it might look like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/954045cb-3836-4956-ab4a-11896642a789/image.png)

In the same manner, if we want to increment the counter by one, we can use the following code:

```c
counter = counter + 1;

// In a more simple way, we usually do this instead.
counter += 1;

// More simple way:
counter++;
```

The first code almost seems like a paradox, but it's the common syntax in programming. A single equal sign is an assignment from right to left. Also, we don't need to mention the keyword `int` when we update an existing variable.

Converting the repeat block from Scratch will look like this:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b3d354e2-741f-4197-9157-353a29ba627d/image.png)

Notice that we create an `int` called `i` and assign it the value `0`. Then, we create a `while` loop that will run until the `i` becomes zero. Whenever the loop runs, we subtract `i` by one.

But that is not what human counts, so we can modify the code like this:

```c
int i = 1;
while (i <= 3)
{
  printf("meow\n");
  i--;
}
```

And this will count `i` from one to three. However, programmers usually start counting from 0, so the go-to syntax, once we get comfortable counting from zero, will be like this:

```c
int i = 0;
while (i < 3)
{
  printf("meow\n");
  i++;
}
```

### For-loop

The most canonical way to solve the loop might be a for-loop, although it takes a little more time to get used to. But this for-loop consolidates into one line all of the same logic.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/b3540038-c776-41b9-af3b-7ec0d5ffcda3/image.png)

The `for` is just a preposition that implies, here comes a loop.

Inside the parentheses, there are three parts.

The first yellow-colored part is initialized to `0`, just like before.

After the initializing part, the loop checks the Boolean expression part. And if `i` is less than three, it prints out `meow`.

Then `i` is going to get incremented. The `i` starts at `0`, and goes to `1`. At that point, the Boolean expression is rechecked. The first step happens only once, and we don't keep changing `i` back to `0`.

When the `i` reaches `3`, the Boolean expression asks, `Is 3 < 3?` and indeed, three is not less than three, so the loop stops.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/6314d40d-c5cf-4f48-a41e-782d7752031a/image.png)

One additional building block, when we recall, Scratch had a `forever` block when we played background music or checked a collision to a wall as such.

The infinite loop is not a good thing in general, but we can implement it by the following code:

```c
int main(void)
{
  while (true)
  {
    printf("meow\n");
  }
}
```

Notice that `true` will always be the case, and if we remind of the transistor, the `0` is false and `1` is true. Therefore, we can replace `true` with `1`, and by doing so, the code will always run.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/32744f22-2a72-4768-b49c-8436b261ca30/image.png)

We will lose control of the terminal window by running this code. To break from the infinite loop, hit `cmd + c or ctrl + c` on the keyboard.

We can encounter the following error if we don't include the `<cs50.h>` library.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/8f1c1e78-f09e-4b71-9955-6c137792e1e9/image.png)

True and false are themselves unique words that we have to include. If we want to use particular Boolean values like this, we must include another library called standard bool, `#include <stdbool.h>`, or the CS50 library alternatively.

## Linux and Command Line Interface

### Linux

_**Linux**_ is an operating system accessible via the command line in the terminal window in VS Code. Essentially, it is just an alternative to macOS or Windows that provides both a GUI and a command-line environment.

Windows and macOS have terminal windows or the equivalent thereof. But Linux is known for, along with other operating systems, its command line environment.

### Terminal in VS Code

The Command Line Interface, or CLI, literally refers to the terminal window. If we go back to the VS Code and close the tab to focus on the terminal window, the terminal window is really just the command line interface to our own server in the cloud.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/284a32a3-8698-4434-9d2d-82b2d0b79763/image.png)

There are many commands or command-line arguments that are worth knowing, and here are some examples.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/c227ee9f-d550-43dc-812e-caf8ffc9fe3d/image.png)

- `cd` stands for change directory, which means changing our current directory(folder)
- `cp` for copying files and directories
- `ls` stands for list and for listing files in a directory
- `mkdir`, for making a directory
- `mv` stands for move and can be used to move and rename files and directories
- `rm`, for removing or deleting files
- `rmdir`, used for removing(deleting) directories

Indeed, these commands are all succinct and abbreviated because we or developers earlier didn't want to type out long commands.

The most commonly used is `ls`, which will list all the files or directories in the current directory.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/f37b4be2-ed98-439d-b09e-dd93098d7889/image.png)

As we can see in the picture, we have green files with an asterisk, which means the file is executable. Besides the green files, we have `.c` files where we write the code and the blue `pset1` directory.

Another useful command is `mv`, where we can move a file from one file to another. Suppose I accidentally created a file called `Greeting`, typed the code, and realized I didn't put the `.c` extension.

Instead of copying all the code and making another file called `greeting.c` and pasting all the code there, we can simply run this `mv Greeting greeting.c` to move all the written code.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/45bdf2c6-c723-473a-bc62-1d1583bb5d6f/image.png)

The above picture suffices to explain the process that we've discussed above. Create a file without the extension, write some code, and move all the code that was written to a new file called `greeting.c`.

We can use the `mkdir pset1` to create a directory, the same as the picture above.

Notice that we ran `ls` but can't see the `mario.c` file. We can see visually on the top left `pset1` folder contains the `mario.c`, but we can't run or compile the file because we are in a different directory.

For instance, if we browse Finder on Mac or File Explorer on Windows, we can double-click to get into that folder. The exact process here is that we have to change into the folder or directory, and `cd` is the command there.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/devbang/post/12e0ba90-77b6-40af-a86a-5bb791cb469a/image.png)

Notice that we have a `pset1/` before the dollar sign, indicating that we are in the directory called `pset1`. We can start running and compile `mario.c` because we are in the right directory.

Ultimately, this command line interface will be a more powerful, capable and efficient mechanism for writing code, running commands, solving problems, and analyzing data more, even though a somewhat stiff learning curve exists.

# ðŸ“Œ Takeaway

- When humans write the source code, the computer or machine can't read the source code. Thus, conversion is needed.
- A compiler is a special program that converts source code into machine code.
- The better-designed and styled code is often faster and maintainable.
- VS Code is our compiler, and `make file.c` will generate or `compile` the machine code from the source code.
- When the command line gets `make file.c` command, the compiler generates the executable file with the same name. Which are not easily accessible and readable by humans.
- Recompiling is needed each time we change the source code.
- In C, we must import a **library** to use a function. Also, we need the escape sequence to switch to the following line after executing the program.
- To use a variable in C, we need to use `format codes`.
- C requires the use of quotation marks separately. When dealing with characters, use `''(single quote)` and `""(double quotes)` for strings.
- Command `mv` moves all the code from a new file to an existing file. Or think it could change the file's name and delete the old one.

- When we evaluate if the code is well written, checking three criteria would be the best standard: the code _correctness_, _design_, and _style_.
- C is pedantic language, in which we need to define every variable type and include the library even for the `printf` function.
- True and False can be represented by `0 and 1`
- There are two patterns of loop, a while loop and a for loop. Also, developers count the number from `0`.
