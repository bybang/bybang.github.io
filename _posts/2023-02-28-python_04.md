# Python Functions 03

## Lamda - anonymous function

Lambda is a function that has no name. It makes the function a one-liner function.

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

sum2 = lambda a, b: a + b
```

### Implicit return

From the above function, you can see there is no `return` state for the lambda function. Implicit return means the function returns the value without the `return`.

The basic Lambda function structure will be like this:

```python
# structure
lambda arg1, arg2: <exp>

# example
greet = lambda greet, name: f'{greet}!! {name}!'
print(greet('Chao', 'Panda'))
```

## Unit tests

Testing your code before launching the app will be important when you enter the **production** level. In this part, we will not go too deep but will learn how to check our written code can be tested.

```python
def sum(a, b):
  return a + b

def test_sum():
  assert sum(1, 5) == 6, '‚úÖ test passed'
  assert sum(-10, 10) == 5, '‚ùå sum does not return correct result'
  assert sum(20, 20) == 1000 , '‚ùå sum does not return correct result'
  assert sum(250, 480) == 730, '‚úÖ test passed'
  print('‚úÖ‚úÖ ALL Test passed(4/4) !!')

test_sum()
```

Imagine we are testing the `sum` function. You can test the function with `assert`. The basic structure is simple.

> 1. Put assert in front of the function.
> 2. Check the result with `==`

```python
assert sum(1, 5) == 6
```

> 3. And put a comma and comment if the result is correct. (or not correct)
> 4. `print("your_msg")` is optional.

```python
assert sum(1, 5) == 6, '‚úÖ test passed'
assert sum(-10, 10) == 5, '‚ùå sum does not return correct result'
print('‚úÖ‚úÖ Test passed(2/2)')
```

### Exercise

Try to assert `calculateFoodTotal()` that we created earlier.

```python
def calculateFoodTotal(food: float, tip_percentage: int) -> float :
  tip = food * (tip_percentage / 100)
  total = food + tip
  print('\n\n')
  print('=================================')
  print(f'üçó Food Amount: ${food}')
  print(f'üí∏ Tip Amount: ${tip}')
  print('\n')
  print(f'üí∞ Total Amount: ${total}')
  print('=================================')
  return total

calculateFoodTotal(food, tip_percentage)
```

Try to write test cases you would like and see the results.

  assert calculateFoodTotal(120, 20) == 144, '‚úÖ test passed'
  assert calculateFoodTotal(120.85, 25) == 151.0625, '‚úÖ test passed'
  assert calculateFoodTotal(120.54, 20.24) == 144, '‚ùå test failed'

test_calculate_food_total()
```

## While statement

Now, let's talk about the `while` statement.

```python
distance = 0
while distance < 20:
  print(f"I'm running {distance}km")
```

‚ùó Don't run this code from your terminal ‚ùó

![Alt text](</images/2023-02-28-python_04/Screen Shot 2023-02-28 at 10.17.41 PM.png>)

It will run the code endlessly because the condition is true.

> If you already ran this code, please do `Ctrl + C` from your terminal.

How to fix this problem? Try to run the code below.

```python
distance = 0
while distance <= 20:
  print(f"I'm running {distance}km")
  distance += 1 # same as distance = distance + 1
```

### Number Guessing Game

As we learned `while`, why not use it?
We are creating a tiny game app with `while`, which will help us understand it better.

```python
print("Welcome to Number guessing game")
winning_number = randint(1, 50)
```

You need to know the Python standard library to create a random number.

#### Python Standard Library

Python has its own library, and we used it already. When? We have been used `print()`, `input()`, and `int()`.
Check out the Python standard library [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)

Because of the size of the library, python can't always load the whole library. So, to use `randint()`, we need to `import` it from the standard library.

```python
from random import randint
```

This is how we can bring functions from `modules`.
Now we can use `randint()`, and continue to make the game.

```python
from random import randint

print("Welcome to Number guessing game")
winning_number = randint(1, 50)

playing = True

while playing:
  user_number = int(input("What is your number? : "))
  if user_number == winning_number:
      print("Congrats!! You win!")
      playing = False
  elif user_number > winning_number:
      print("Sorry, Go lower")
  elif user_number < winning_number:
      print("Sorry, Go higher")
```

The result should be like this:

‚ùóRemember, `while` runs the code if it is true. Stopping the `while` function will be the developer's duty. Check and try to understand the control flow of the game, not just memorize it.
