## Programming languages

In the 10-year cycle, 40~50 programming languages are evolving. As a developer, we should choose a language for the desired product that we wish to develop. So, what is suitable for web development?

### Low-level languages

As we know, the computer has a switch or transistor to communicate. The computer gets electricity and turns on and off the transistor, representing 0 and 1.

The computer uses a Binary system, and the low-level language means the language that the computer understands. If the developer writes a code with only binary code, which we call a **machine language**.

But humans can't understand the machine code easily, so the old developer invented a more developer-friendly programming language.

Of course, the programming language differs from machine language, so we need additional tools to `compile` this language.

In this process, two more conventions came out. We called the tool `compiler` and the translating language as `Assembly language`.

Nowadays, it is difficult to find a program developed in machine or assembly language due to its complicated structure.

### High-level languages

Essentially, high-level languages are more human-friendly languages. As the hardware specs increased gradually, the compiler was upgraded.

We can now develop in a readable and human grammar way with these high compiler specs.

We have many high-level languages, including famous languages such as C, Swift, Kotlin, Java, Python and JavaScript.

Less famous languages include Fortran for scientific calculation, Erlang for OTP(Open Telecom Platform) or Lisp.

### Most popular languages in web development

- Python: Recommended for beginner developers due to its extremely human-friendly syntax. It is often used in data science and machine learning these days.
- PHP: Still one of the most popular languages in web development. The research from W3Techs shows that 77% of websites used PHP in 2023.
- JavaScript: Rules the current web market. From W3Techs research, 98.7% of websites used JavaScript as of 2023.
- Java: Dominates the back-end development, especially for enterprise software. The big projects or company still uses Java for their back-end.

# üìå Takeaway

- There are many languages out in the market, roughly 700-9000 languages in total.
- The translating language between the compiler and the machine code is called assembly language.
- PHP is still alive among the popular web development languages such as JavaScript or Python.
- Java is preferred in enterprise environments; hence, companies hire Java back-end developers.

# üíª Solution

## Questions

### Q1) If we can use one programming language for web development, which language should we use?

My answer: JavaScript or Python
Both languages can handle front/back end development by their own libraries and environment, such as Node.js or Next.js for JavaScript and Django for Python.

### Q2) What is the best language that is easy to read and develop and has a huge library?

My answer: Python
Python is recommended for the majority of beginner developers due to its easy syntax and also has a huge library from a huge community.

### Q3) What is the benefit of having a good community for a programming language?

My answer: If the language has a good community, the users will develop more efficient and helpful libraries. More interest in the community will collect more users, and eventually, the community will create a virtuous cycle.

# üîñ Review

- One programming language for web development: JavaScript
  - JavaScript is versatile and used for Full-stack development
  - It has a large ecosystem with a rich set of libraries and frameworks
- The best language for easy to read and develop: Python
  - Python is known for its clean and readable syntax
  - Ease of development and versatility are also the benefits of Python
- Having a strong community offers several benefits:
  - Support and collaboration
  - Knowledge sharing
  - Open-source contributions
  - Job opportunities
  - Tooling and ecosystem growth
